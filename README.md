## Using this material

NOTE: This is *not* Carpentries boilerplate! Please read carefully.

1. Follow the instructions found in The Carpentries' [example lesson](
   https://github.com/carpentries/lesson-example/) to create a repository for
   your lesson. Install Ruby, Make, and Jekyll following the instructions
   [here](http://carpentries.github.io/lesson-example/setup.html).

1. For easier portability, we use snippets of text and code to capture inputs
   and outputs that are host- or site-specific and cannot be scripted. These
   are stored in a library
   [_includes/snippets_library](_includes/snippets_library), with
   subdirectories matching the pattern `InstitutionName_ClusterName_scheduler`.
   If your cluster is not already present, please copy (`cp -r`) the *closest
   match* as a new folder under `snippets_library`.

   * We have placed snippets in files with the `.snip` extension, to make
     tracking easier. These files contain Markdown-formatted text, and will
     render to HTML when the lesson is built.
   * Code snippets are placed in subdirectories that are named according to the
     episode they appear in. For example, if the snippet is for episode 12, then
     it will be in a subdirectory called `12`.
   * In the episodes source, snippets are included using [Liquid](
     https://shopify.github.io/liquid/) scripting `include` statements. For
     example, the first snippet in episode 12 is included using
     `{% include /snippets/12/info.snip %}`.

1. Edit `_config_options.yml` in your snippets folder. These options set such
   things as the address of the host to login to, definitions of the command
   prompt, and scheduler names. You can also change the order of the episodes,
   or omit episodes, by editing the configuration block under `episode_names`
   in this file.

1. Set the environment variable `HPC_JEKYLL_CONFIG` to the relative path of the
   configuration file in your snippets folder:

   ```bash
   export HPC_JEKYLL_CONFIG=_includes/snippets_library/.../_config_options.yml
   ```

1. Preview the lesson locally, by running `make serve`. You can then view the
   website in your browser, following the links in the output (usually,
   <https://localhost:4000>). Pages will be automatically regenerated every
   time you write to them.

1. If there are discrepancies in the output, edit the snippet file containing
   it, or create a new one and customize.

1. Add your snippet directory name to the GitHub Actions configuration file,
   [.github/workflows/test_and_build.yml](.github/workflows/test_and_build.yml).

1. Check out a new branch(`git checkout -b new_branch_name`), commit your
   changes, and push to your fork of the repository. If you're comfortable
   sharing, please file a Pull Request against our [upstream repo](
   https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/hpc-intro). We would love to have
   your site config for the Library.

1. To maintain compatibility, please *do not* merge your new branch into your
   fork's `gh-pages` branch. Instead, wait until your pull request has been
   merged upstream, then pull down the upstream version. Otherwise, your
   repository will *diverge* from ours, and pull requests you make in the
   future will probably not be accepted.

## Deploying a Customized Lesson

The steps above will help you port the default HPC Intro lesson to your
specific cluster, but the changes will only be visible on your local machine.
To build a website for a specific workshop or instance of the lesson, you'll
want to make a stand-alone copy.

### Template Your Customized Repository

This will let you create an exact duplicate of your fork. Without this, GitHub
won't let you create a second fork of a repository on the same account.

1. On GitHub, go to your repository's **Settings**.
1. Under the repository name, check the "Template Repository" box.
1. Go to the **Code** tab.
1. Click the new button to **Use This Template**.
1. Fill in a name, like `yyyy-mm-dd-hpc-intro`.
1. Check the **Include all branches** box.
1. Go!

### Merge Your Customized Branch

If your snippets are already included in the snippet library, skip this step.

1. On GitHub, find the drop-down menu of branches. It should be all the way to
   the left of the "Use This Template" button.
1. From the list, select the branch containing your site customization.
1. There should be a bar above the list of repository contents with the branch
   name, stating "This branch is *x* commits ahead, *y* commits behind
   `gh-pages`" or similar. To the right of that, click the button to **Create
   Pull Request**.
1. Make sure that the source and destination repositories at the top of the new
   PR are *both* your current duplicate of hpc-intro, not the upstream.
1. Create the pull request, then click the **Merge** button. You can delete the
   customization branch when it's done.

### Modify `_config.yml`

GitHub builds sites using the top-level [`_config.yml`](_config.yml), only, but
you want the values set in the snippet library.

1. Open a copy of your
  `_includes/snippet_library/Institution_Cluster_scheduler/_config_options.yml`
1. On GitHub, open the top-level `_config.yml` for editing.
1. Copy your `_config_options.yml`, overwriting the values under the **SITE
   specific configuration** section of the top-level `_config.yml`. Leave the
   rest as-is.
1. Commit the change.
1. Back on the **Code** tab, there should be a timer icon, a green check, or a
   red X next to the latest commit hash. If it's a timer, the site is building;
   give it time.
1. If the symbol is a red x, something went wrong. Click it to open the build
   log, and attempt to correct the error. Follow GitHub's troubleshooting
   guide, and double-check the values in `_config.yml` ar ecorrect and
   complete.
1. Once you see a green check, your website will be available for viewing at
   `https://your-github-account.github.io/name-of-the-repository`.

## Lesson Outlines

The following list of items is meant as a guide on what content should go where
in this repo. This should work as a guide where you can contribute. If a bullet
point is prefixed by a file name, this is the lesson where the listed content
should go into. This document is meant as a concept map converted into a flow
of learning goals and questions. Note, again, that it is possible, when
building your actual lesson, to re-order these files, or omit one or more of
them.

### Nascent lesson ideas

1. Playing friendly in the cluster (psteinb: the following is very tricky as it
   is site dependent, I personally would like to see it in
   [_extras](
   https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/hpc-intro/tree/gh-pages/_extras)

   * Understanding resource utilisation
   * Profiling code &mdash; time, size, etc.
   * Getting system stats
   * Consequences of going over

1. Filesystems and Storage: objectives likely include items from @psteinb's
   [Shared Filesystem lesson](
https://github.com/psteinb/hpc-in-a-day/blob/gh-pages/_episodes/01-04-shared-filesystem.md):

   * Understand the difference between a local and shared / network filesystem
   * Learn about high performance / scratch filesystems
   * Raise attention that misuse (intentional or not) of a common file system
     negatively affects all users very quickly.
   * Possible tools: `echo $TEMP`, `ls -al /tmp`, `df`, `quota`

1. Advanced Job Scripting and Submission:

   * Checking status of jobs (`squeue`, `bjobs` etc.), explain different job
     states and relate to scheduler basics
   * Cancelling/deleting a job (`scancel`, `bkill` etc.)
   * Passing options to the scheduler (log files)
   * Callout: Changing a job's name
   * Optional Callout: Send an email once the job completes (not all sites
     support sending emails)
   * for a starting point, see [this](
     https://psteinb.github.io/hpc-in-a-day/02-02-advanced-job-scheduling/)
     for reference

1. Filesystem Zoo:

   * execute a job that collects node information and stores the output to
     `/tmp`
   * ask participants where the output went and why they can't see it
   * execute a job that collects node information and stores the output to
     `/shared` or however your shared file system is called
   * for a starting point, see [this](
     https://psteinb.github.io/hpc-in-a-day/02-03-shared-filesystem/)
