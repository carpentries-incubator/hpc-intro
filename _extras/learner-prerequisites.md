## Pre-Workshop Survey

For a motivation of this survey type, see Greg Wilson's template in [Teaching
Tech Together](
https://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#s:checklists-preassess).

### Shell

#### Moving Things

You are provided with a directory of 300 files that end with `.log`, `.data`
and `.err` at equal proportions. You want to rename all `.log` files to `.out`
files. How do you do this?

1. I can do that. Give me a shell and I'll show you.
1. I'd need to look up the syntax in a cheatsheet or some old code and I'm good
   to do this.
1. I am unclear about this, I'd have to consult a colleague or a search engine
   to do this.
1. I am not sure what to do.

#### Moving around

You are on `/bigdata/users/wolfman/projects/study` and want to jump over to
`/bigdata/projects/experiments/at-moonlight` on the command line.

1. I can do that. Give me a shell and I'll show you.
1. I'd need to look up the syntax in a cheatsheet or some old code and I'm good
   to do this.
1. I am unclear about this, I'd have to consult a colleague or a search engine
   to do this.
1. I am not sure what to do.

#### Collaborator Candy

A collaborator provides you an implementation of a state-of-the-art simulation
that you need to compare your own predictions to. He tells you: "You can use it
on the command line right away. Unpack the file I sent you and use the `sim`
executable in the `bin/` folder from it. The rest is explained in the output of
the `--help` flag."

You want to use this new program on your cluster, starting with reading the
"help" message from the `sim` executable.

1. I can do that. Give me a shell and I'll show you.
1. I'd need to look up the syntax in a cheatsheet or some old code and I'm good
   to do this.
1. I am unclear about this, I'd have to consult a colleague or a search engine
   to do this.
1. I am not sure what to do.

#### Automating All The Things

You notice that you've been copying & pasting the same sequence of 5 shell
commands more than a few times during the day. It occurs to you that capturing
the workflow in a shell script would simplify the task and make it more
repeatable. The script would take two arguments, i.e. the file to read data
from and a new filename to write the processed results into.

   to do this.
