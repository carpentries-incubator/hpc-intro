## Glossary

The following list captures terms that need to be added to this glossary. This
is a great way to contribute.

{:auto_ids}
[Accelerator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_acceleration)
:    *to be defined*

[Beowulf cluster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beowulf_cluster)
:    *to be defined*

[Central processing unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPU)
:     or simply *processor* is the (hardware) component of a computer that
      executes the instructions supplied by a program (software). Most modern
      desktop computers have multi-core processors, e.g. devices with 2 CPUs
      are called dual-core, with 4 cores are called quad-core and so on. Each
      **core** is a separate physical implementation of the electronic
      circuitry required to execute instructions.

[Cloud computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing)
:    *to be defined*

[Cluster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_cluster)
:     a collection of computers configured to enable collaboration on a common
      task by means of purposefully configured hardware (e.g., networking)
      and software (e.g. workload management).
