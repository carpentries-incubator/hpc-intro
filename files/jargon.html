# High Performance Computing Jargon Buster

HPC Carpentry is a community effort to develop educational materials
in the pedagogical style of The Carpentries.

The point of this presentation is to briefly introduce some scale-up
options, so that learners get a sense of the variety of ways this can
be done, and the source of some of the overloading of terminology
that will be used later in the lesson.

This non-interactive activity should be kept brief.

# Your Personal Computer

.center[
![Standalone computers (banana for scale)](../fig/jargon_standalone.svg)
]

- Familiar starting point, accessed locally
- Good for local computational tasks
- Highly flexible, easy to reconfigure for new tasks

???

A laptop and a desktop computer: you sit at the keyboard & mouse and
log in to the computer directly, often as the sole user.

Good at performing local and personal tasks: limited resources, but
familiar to all of us.

# Shared Computing Resources

- Large-scale computation is different
- It has a rich history, and confusing terminology
- Many terms overloaded

???

Computational at larger scales typically involves changes in how
things are done, and connection to remote computer systems and
transfer of data between systems.

There are many ways to do it, and the terminology can be confusing.

This presentation will step through some scale-up scenarios to help
frame the problem.

# A large computer

.center[
![A large computer (banana for scale)](../fig/jargon_large_computer.svg)
]

- More powerful "compute server"
- Accessed remotely, likely shared by a small group
- Less flexible &mdash; need to accommodate other users

???

First obvious way to scale, has more CPUs and memory, and more or
faster storage.Typically shared, run commercial or open-source OSs,
may be called a "compute server". Typical tasks are operations of
large user-facing programs, like scientific models or visualizations.

# Cloud Systems

.center[
![Cloud computers (bananas for scale)](../fig/jargon_multi_cluster.svg)
]

- Generally quite heterogeneous
- Many types of servers

???

Cloud systems physically resemble clusters or supercomputers, but
with greater heterogeneity among components, and less coupling, often
without an interconnect at all. Cloud servers are generally accessed
by connecting to their services over the network. Multiple VMs may
reside on individual physical machines. Typical tasks are driven by
user connections from the outside to the various "front end" services
(e.g. web sites) which pass traffic on to the "back end" servers
(e.g. databases) to present results to users.

# A cluster or supercomputer

.center[
![A cluster (banana for scale)](../fig/jargon_cluster.svg)
]

- Special "login node" or "head node" accessed remotely by users
- Compute service accessed via resource manager
- Some flexibility on local accounts
- Specially-built software for best performance

# HPC workflow

.center[
![Schematic HPC workflow](../fig/jargon_workflow.png)
]

- You talk to the cluster head node
- The cluster head node distributes compute tasks
- You view results

???

In the usual HPC workflow, users do not communicate directly with
compute nodes, but work through a scheduling system to distribute
tasks.
