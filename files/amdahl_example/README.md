# What does this directory contain?

This directory contains an example application that can be used as a black box
to reproduce Amdahl's Law. It does not do real calculations, nor any real
communication, so can easily be overloaded.

The application can be found in the tarball and is a python script with a shell
script wrapper. The only requirement is MPI4PY.

## Additional files

Also included an configuration file for EasyBuild (which might be useful if you
use EasyBuild). Also included is the module file generated by EasyBuild (which
might be useful if you do not use EasyBuild).
