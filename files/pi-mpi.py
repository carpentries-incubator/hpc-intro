"""Parallel example code for estimating the value of π.

We can estimate the value of π by a stochastic algorithm. Consider a
circle of radius 1, inside a square that bounds it, with vertices at
(1,1), (1,-1), (-1,-1), and (-1,1). The area of the circle is just π,
whereas the area of the square is 4. So, the fraction of the area of the
square which is covered by the circle is π/4.

A point selected at random uniformly from the square thus has a
probability π/4 of being within the circle.

We can estimate π by examining a large number of randomly-selected
points from the square, and seeing what fraction of them lie within the
circle. If this fraction is f, then our estimate for π is π ≈ 4f.

Thanks to symmetry, we can compute points in one quadrant, rather
than within the entire unit square, and arrive at identical results.

This task lends itself naturally to parallelization -- the task of
selecting a sample point and deciding whether or not it's inside the
circle is independent of all the other samples, so they can be done
simultaneously. We only need to aggregate the data at the end to compute
our fraction f and our estimate for π.
