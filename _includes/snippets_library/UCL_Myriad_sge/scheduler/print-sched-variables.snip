> ## Job environment variables
>
> When {{ site.sched.name }} runs a job, it sets a number of environment
> variables for the job. One of these will let us check what directory our job
> script was submitted from. The `SGE_O_WORKDIR` variable is set to the
> directory from which our job was submitted.
>
> Using the `SGE_O_WORKDIR` variable, modify your job so that it prints out the
> location from which the job was submitted.
