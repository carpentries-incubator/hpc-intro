For an interactive session, you reserve some compute nodes via the scheduler
and then are logged in live, just like on the login nodes. These can be used
for live visualisation, software debugging, or to work up a script to run your
program without having to submit each attempt separately to the queue and wait
for it to complete.

```
{{ site.remote.prompt }} {{ site.sched.interactive }} {{ site.sched.flag.interactive }}
```
{: .language-bash}

All `{{ site.sched.submit.name }}` options are supported like regular job
submission with the difference that with `{{ site.sched.interactive }}` they
must be given at the command line, and not with any job script. Once a node is
allocated to you, you should be presented with a bash prompt. Note that the
prompt will likely change to reflect your new location, in this case the worker
node we are logged on. You can also verify this with `hostname`.

When you are done with the interactive job, type exit to quit your session.
