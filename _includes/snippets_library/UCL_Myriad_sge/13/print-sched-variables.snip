> ## Job environment variables
>
> When SGE runs a job, it sets a number of environment variables for the job.
> One of these will let us check what directory our job script was submitted from.
> The `SGE_O_WORKDIR` variable is set to the directory from which our job was 
> submitted.  Using the `SGE_O_WORKDIR` variable, modify your job
> so that it prints (to stdout) the location from which the job was submitted.
