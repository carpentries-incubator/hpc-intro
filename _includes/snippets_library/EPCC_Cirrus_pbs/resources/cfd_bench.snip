> ## Resources for Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)
>
> Copy the Python 2D CFD application from the course website to the HPC system
  using the following command:
>
> ```
> {{ site.workshop_host.prompt }} wget {{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/files/cfd.tar.gz
> ```
> {: .language-bash}
>
> Then unpack it using
>
> ```
> {{ site.workshop_host.prompt }} tar -xvf cfd.tar.gz
> ```
> {: .language-bash}
>
> Create a job that runs the following commands in the directory containing the
> `cfd.py` program.
>
> ```
> module load anaconda/python2
> python cfd.py 3 20000
> ```
> {: .language-bash}
>
> You'll need to figure out a good amount of resources to ask for for this
> first "test run". You might also want to have the scheduler email you to tell
> you when the job is done.
>
> Hint: the job only needs 1 cpu and not too much time.
> The trick is figuring out just how much you'll need!
>
> Do not forget to check the `.e` file produced by the job to make sure there
> are no errors! You should also check the `.o` file produced by the job to
> make sure it contains the output from the CFD program.
