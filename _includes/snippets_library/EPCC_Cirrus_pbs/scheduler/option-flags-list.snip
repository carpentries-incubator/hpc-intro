* `-l select=<nnodes>:ncpus=<ncores per node>` &mdash; how many nodes does your
  job need and how many cores per node? Note that there are 36 cores per node
  on Cirrus.

* `-l walltime=<hours:minutes:seconds>` &mdash; How much real-world time
  (walltime) will your job take to run?

* `-l place=scatter:excl` &mdash; Reserve your nodes just for yourself. (If you
  are using full nodes, you should include this as it stops other users from
  interfering with the performance of your job.)
