`{{ site.sched.interactive }}` (with the right options) can submit a job and
then wait for it to start so we can use the compute node resources
interactively. Letâ€™s demonstrate this by submitting an interactive job that
uses a single core:

```
{{ site.remote.prompt }} {{ site.sched.interactive }} {{ site.sched.flag.interactive }}
```
{: .language-bash}

You should be presented with a bash prompt. Note that the prompt will likely
change to reflect your new location, in this case the worker node we are logged
on. You can also verify this with `hostname`.

When you are done with the interactive job, type `exit` to quit your session.
