> ## Job environment variables
>
> When {{ site.sched.name }} runs a job, it sets a number of environment variables for the job. One of these will
> let us check what directory our job script was submitted from. The `PBS_O_WORKDIR` variable is
> set to the directory from which our job was submitted.
>
> Using the `PBS_O_WORKDIR` variable, modify your job so that it prints out the location
> from which the job was submitted.
