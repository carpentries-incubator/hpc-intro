# NIST CTCMS Slurm
#------------------------------------------------------------

# Cluster host and scheduler options: the defaults come from
# Graham at Compute Canada, running Slurm. Other options can
# be found in the library of snippets,
# `_includes/snippets_library`. To use one, replace options
# below with those in `_config_options.yml` from the
# library. E.g, to customise for Cirrus at EPCC, running
# Slurm, we could replace the options below with those from
# 
# _includes/snippets_library/EPCC_Cirrus_slurm/_config_options.yml
# 
# If your cluster is not represented in the library, please
# copy an existing folder, rename it, and customize for your
# installation. Remember to keep the leading slash on the
# `snippets` variable below!
