# Magic Castle: Slurm + Software Stack from EESSI
#------------------------------------------------------------

# Cluster host and scheduler options: the defaults come from
# Graham at Compute Canada, running Slurm. Other options for
# other systems can be found in the library of snippets,
# `_includes/snippets_library`.
#
# Please refer to
# https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/hpc-intro#using-this-material
# in order to see how to include a specific set of snippets
# in your lesson and
# https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/hpc-intro#deploying-a-customized-lesson
# in order to see how to deploy a specific instance of a lesson.
#
# If your cluster is not represented in the library, please
# copy an existing folder, rename it, and customize for your
# installation. Remember to keep the leading slash on the
# `snippets` variable below!
#
# For this specific snippet library that uses Magic Castle (
# https://github.com/ComputeCanada/magic_castle/tree/master/docs#magic-castle-documentation
# ) with the EESSI (https://eessi.github.io/docs/) software
# stack you will most likely also need to provide a customised
# version of the cluster name and domain, which is currently
# set to
# "custom.learnhpc.eu".
# For example, if our cluster was called
# "cluster.hpc-carpentry.org", we could do this in a
# single `sed` command from the current directory:
# sed -i s/custom.learnhpc.eu/cluster.hpc-carpentry.org/g _config_options.yml
