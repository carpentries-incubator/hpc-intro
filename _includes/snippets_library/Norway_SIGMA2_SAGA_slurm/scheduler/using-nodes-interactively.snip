`srun` runs a single command on the cluster and then exits. Let's demonstrate
this by running the `hostname` command with `srun`. (We can cancel an `srun`
job with `Ctrl-c`.)

```
{{ site.host_prompt }} srun hostname
```
{: .language-bash}
```
gra752
```
{: .output}

`srun` accepts all of the same options as `sbatch`. However, instead of
specifying these in a script, these options are specified on the command-line
when starting a job. To submit a job that uses 2 CPUs for instance, we could
use the following command:

```
{{ site.host_prompt }} srun -n 2 echo "This job will use 2 CPUs."
```
{: .language-bash}
```
This job will use 2 CPUs.
This job will use 2 CPUs.
```
{: .output}

Typically, the resulting shell environment will be the same as that for
`sbatch`.

### Interactive jobs

Sometimes, you will need a lot of resource for interactive use. Perhaps it's
our first time running an analysis or we are attempting to debug something that
went wrong with a previous job. Fortunately, SLURM makes it easy to start an
interactive job with `srun`:

```
{{ site.host_prompt }} srun --pty bash
```
{: .language-bash}

You should be presented with a bash prompt. Note that the prompt will likely
change to reflect your new location, in this case the compute node we are
logged on. You can also verify this with `hostname`.

When you are done with the interactive job, type `exit` to quit your session.
