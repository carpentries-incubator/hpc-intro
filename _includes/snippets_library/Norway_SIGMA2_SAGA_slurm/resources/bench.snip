> ## Benchmarking `fastqc`
>
> Create a job that runs the following command in the same directory as
> `.fastq` files
>
> ```
> fastqc name_of_fastq_file
> ```
> {: .language-bash}
>
> The `fastqc` command is provided by the `fastqc` module. You'll need to
> figure out a good amount of resources to ask for for this first "test run".
> You might also want to have the scheduler email you to tell you when the job
> is done.
>
> Hint: the job only needs 1 CPU and not too much memory or time. The trick is
> figuring out just how much you'll need!
