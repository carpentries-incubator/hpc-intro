Let's take a closer look at the `gcc` module. GCC is an extremely widely used
C/C++/Fortran compiler. Lots of software is dependent on the GCC version, and
might not compile or run if the wrong version is loaded. In this case, there
are four different versions: `gcc/6.2.0`, `gcc/6.3.0`, `gcc/8.2.0` and `gcc/10.2.0`.
How do we load each copy and which copy is the default?

In this case, `gcc/6.3.0` has a `(default)` next to it. This indicates that it
is the default - if we type `module load gcc`, this is the copy that will be
loaded.

```
{{ site.remote.prompt }} module load gcc
{{ site.remote.prompt }} gcc --version
```
{: .language-bash}

```
gcc (GCC) 6.3.0

```
{: .output}

So how do we load the non-default copy of a software package? In this case, the
only change we need to make is be more specific about the module we are
loading. There are four GCC modules: `gcc/6.2.0`, `gcc/6.3.0`, `gcc/8.2.0` and `gcc/10.2.0`
To load a non-default module, we need to make add the version number after the
`/` in our `module load` command

```
{{ site.remote.prompt }} module load gcc/10.2.0
```
{: .language-bash}

```
WARNING: gcc/10.2.0 cannot be loaded due to a conflict.
HINT: Might try "module unload gcc" first.
```
{: .output}

What happened? The module command is telling us that we cannot have two `gcc`
modules loaded at the same time as this could cause confusion about which
version you are using. We need to remove the default version before we load the
new version.

```
{{ site.remote.prompt }} module unload gcc
{{ site.remote.prompt }} module load gcc/10.2.0
{{ site.remote.prompt }} gcc --version
```
{: .language-bash}

```
gcc (GCC) 10.2.0
Copyright (C) 2020 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
This is free software; see the source for copying conditions.  There is NO
warranty; not even for MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
```
{: .output}

We now have successfully switched from GCC 6.3.0 to GCC 10.2.0.

As switching between different versions of the same module is often used you
can use `module swap` rather than unloading one version before loading another.
The equivalent of the steps above would be:

```
{{ site.remote.prompt }} module unload gcc/10.2.0
{{ site.remote.prompt }} module load gcc
{{ site.remote.prompt }} gcc --version
{{ site.remote.prompt }} module swap gcc gcc/10.2.0
{{ site.remote.prompt }} gcc --version
```
{: .language-bash}

```
gcc (GCC) 6.3.0
Copyright (C) 2016 Free Software Foundation, Inc.

gcc (GCC) 10.2.0

warranty; not even for MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
```
{: .output}

This achieves the same result as unload followed by load but in a single step.
