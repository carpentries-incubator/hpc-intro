`{{ site.sched.interactive }}` runs a single command on the cluster and then
exits. Let's demonstrate this by running the `hostname` command with `{{
site.sched.interactive }}`. (We can cancel an `{{ site.sched.interactive }}`
job with `Ctrl-c`.)

```
{{ site.remote.prompt }} {{ site.sched.interactive }} hostname
```
{: .language-bash}

```
gra752
```
{: .output}

`{{ site.sched.interactive }}` accepts all of the same options as `{{
site.sched.submit.name }}`. However, instead of specifying these in a script,
these options are specified on the command-line when starting a job. To submit
a job that uses 2 CPUs for instance, we could use the following command:

```
{{ site.remote.prompt }} {{ site.sched.interactive }} -n 2 echo "This job will use 2 CPUs."
```
{: .language-bash}

```
This job will use 2 CPUs.
This job will use 2 CPUs.
```
{: .output}

Typically, the resulting shell environment will be the same as that for
`{{ site.sched.submit.name }}`.

### Interactive jobs

Sometimes, you will need a lot of resource for interactive use. Perhaps it's
our first time running an analysis or we are attempting to debug something that
went wrong with a previous job. Fortunately, {{ site.sched.name }} makes it
easy to start an interactive job with `{{ site.sched.interactive }}`:

```
{{ site.remote.prompt }} {{ site.sched.interactive }} --pty bash
```
{: .language-bash}

You should be presented with a bash prompt. Note that the prompt will likely
change to reflect your new location, in this case the compute node we are
logged on. You can also verify this with `hostname`.

{: .callout}

When you are done with the interactive job, type `exit` to quit your session.
