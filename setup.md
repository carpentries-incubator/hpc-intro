There are several pieces of software you will wish to install before the workshop.
Though installation help will be provided at the workshop, 
we recommend that these tools are installed (or at least downloaded) beforehand.

## SSH

All students should have an SSH client installed.
SSH is a tool that allows us to connect to and use a remote computer as our own.
Please follow the directions below to install an SSH client for your system.

**Windows**

Install MobaXterm from [http://mobaxterm.mobatek.net](http://mobaxterm.mobatek.net).
You will want to get the Home edition (Installer edition).

**macOS**

Although macOS comes with SSH pre-installed, 
you will likely want to install [XQuartz](https://www.xquartz.org) to enable graphical support.
Note that you must restart your computer to complete the installation.

**Linux**

Linux users do not need to install anything, you should be set!
