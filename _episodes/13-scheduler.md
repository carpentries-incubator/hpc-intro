## Job scheduler

An HPC system might have thousands of nodes and thousands of users. How do we
decide who gets what and when? How do we ensure that a task is run with the
resources it needs? This job is handled by a special piece of software called
the scheduler. On an HPC system, the scheduler manages which jobs run where and
when.

The following illustration compares these tasks of a job scheduler to a waiter
in a restaurant. If you can relate to an instance where you had to wait for a
while in a queue to get in to a popular restaurant, then you may now understand
why sometimes your job do not start instantly as in your laptop.

The scheduler used in this lesson is {{ site.sched.name }}. Although
{{ site.sched.name }} is not used everywhere, running jobs is quite similar
regardless of what software is being used. The exact syntax might change, but
the concepts remain the same.

## Running a batch job

The most basic use of the scheduler is to run a command non-interactively. Any
command (or series of commands) that you want to run on the cluster is called a
*job*, and the process of using a scheduler to run the job is called *batch job
submission*.

In this case, the job we want to run is just a shell script. Let's create a
demo shell script to run as a test. The landing pad will have a number of
terminal-based text editors installed. Use whichever you prefer. Unsure? `nano`
is a pretty good, basic choice.

```
{{ site.remote.prompt }} nano example-job.sh
{{ site.remote.prompt }} chmod +x example-job.sh
{{ site.remote.prompt }} cat example-job.sh
```
{: .language-bash}

```
{{ site.remote.bash_shebang }}

echo -n "This script is running on "
hostname
```
{: .output}

> ## Creating our test job
>
> Run the script. Does it execute on the cluster or just our login node?
>
> > ## Solution
> >
> > ```
> > {{ site.remote.prompt }} ./example-job.sh
> > ```
> > {: .language-bash}
> > ```
> > This script is running on {{ site.remote.host }}
> > ```
> > {: .output}
> >
> > This job runs on the login node.
> {: .solution}
{: .challenge}

If you completed the previous challenge successfully, you probably realise that
there is a distinction between running the job through the scheduler and just
"running it". To submit this job to the scheduler, we use the `{{
site.sched.submit.name }}` command.

```
{{ site.remote.prompt }} {{ site.sched.submit.name }} {{ site.sched.submit.options }} example-job.sh
```
{: .language-bash}

{% include {{ site.snippets }}/scheduler/basic-job-script.snip %}

And that's all we need to do to submit a job. Our work is done &mdash; now the
scheduler takes over and tries to run the job for us. While the job is waiting
to run, it goes into a list of jobs called the *queue*. To check on our job's
status, we check the queue using the command
`{{ site.sched.status }} {{ site.sched.flag.user }}`.

```
{{ site.remote.prompt }} {{ site.sched.status }} {{ site.sched.flag.user }}
```
{: .language-bash}

{% include {{ site.snippets }}/scheduler/basic-job-status.snip %}

The best way to check our job's status is with `{{ site.sched.status }}`. Of
course, running `{{ site.sched.status }}` repeatedly to check on things can be
a little tiresome. To see a real-time view of our jobs, we can use the `watch`
command. `watch` reruns a given command at 2-second intervals. This is too
frequent, and will likely upset your system administrator. You can change the
interval to a more reasonable value, for example 15 seconds, with the `-n 15`
parameter. Let's try using it to monitor another job.

```
{{ site.remote.prompt }} {{ site.sched.submit.name }} {{ site.sched.submit.options }} example-job.sh
{{ site.remote.prompt }} watch -n 15 {{ site.sched.status }} {{ site.sched.flag.user }}
```
{: .language-bash}

You should see an auto-updating display of your job's status. When it finishes,
it will disappear from the queue. Press `Ctrl-c` when you want to stop the
`watch` command.

> ## Where's the output?
>
> On the login node, this script printed output to the terminal &mdash; but
> when we exit `watch`, there's nothing. Where'd it go?
>
> Cluster job output is typically redirected to a file in the directory you
> launched it from. Use `ls` to find and read the file.

## Customising a job

The job we just ran used all of the scheduler's default options. In a
real-world scenario, that's probably not what we want. The default options
represent a reasonable minimum. Chances are, we will need more cores, more
memory, more time, among other special considerations. To get access to these
resources we must customize our job script.

Comments in UNIX shell scripts (denoted by `#`) are typically ignored, but
there are exceptions. For instance the special `#!` comment at the beginning of
scripts specifies what program should be used to run it (you'll typically see
`{{ site.local.bash_shebang }}`). Schedulers like {{ site.sched.name }} also
have a special comment used to denote special scheduler-specific options.
Though these comments differ from scheduler to scheduler,
{{ site.sched.name }}'s special comment is `{{ site.sched.comment }}`. Anything
following the `{{ site.sched.comment }}` comment is interpreted as an
instruction to the scheduler.

Let's illustrate this by example. By default, a job's name is the name of the
script, but the `{{ site.sched.flag.name }}` option can be used to change the
name of a job. Add an option to the script:

```
{{ site.remote.prompt }} cat example-job.sh
```
{: .language-bash}

```
{{ site.remote.bash_shebang }}
{{ site.sched.comment }} {{ site.sched.flag.name }} new_name

echo -n "This script is running on "
hostname
echo "This script has finished successfully."
```
{: .output}

Submit the job and monitor its status:

```
{{ site.remote.prompt }} {{ site.sched.submit.name }} {{ site.sched.submit.options }} example-job.sh
{{ site.remote.prompt }} {{ site.sched.status }} {{ site.sched.flag.user }}
```
{: .language-bash}

{% include {{ site.snippets }}/scheduler/job-with-name-status.snip %}

Fantastic, we've successfully changed the name of our job!

### Resource requests

But what about more important changes, such as the number of cores and memory
for our jobs? One thing that is absolutely critical when working on an HPC
system is specifying the resources required to run a job. This allows the
scheduler to find the right time and place to schedule our job. If you do not
specify requirements (such as the amount of time you need), you will likely be
stuck with your site's default resources, which is probably not what you want.

The following are several key resource requests:

{% include {{ site.snippets }}/scheduler/option-flags-list.snip %}

Note that just *requesting* these resources does not make your job run faster,
nor does it necessarily mean that you will consume all of these resources. It
only means that these are made available to you. Your job may end up using less
memory, or less time, or fewer tasks or nodes, than you have requested, and it
will still run.

It's best if your requests accurately reflect your job's requirements. We'll
talk more about how to make sure that you're using resources effectively in a
later episode of this lesson.

{: .challenge}

{% include {{ site.snippets }}/scheduler/print-sched-variables.snip %}

Resource requests are typically binding. If you exceed them, your job will be
killed. Let's use walltime as an example. We will request 30 seconds of
walltime, and attempt to run a job for two minutes.

```
{{ site.remote.prompt }} cat example-job.sh
```
{: .language-bash}

```
{{ site.remote.bash_shebang }}
{{ site.sched.comment }} {{ site.sched.flag.name }} long_job
{{ site.sched.comment }} {{ site.sched.flag.time }} 00:00:30

echo "This script is running on ... "
sleep 120 # time in seconds
hostname
echo "This script has finished successfully."
```
{: .output}

Submit the job and wait for it to finish. Once it is has finished, check the
log file.

```
{{ site.remote.prompt }} {{ site.sched.submit.name }} {{ site.sched.submit.options }} example-job.sh
{{ site.remote.prompt }} watch -n 15 {{ site.sched.status }} {{ site.sched.flag.user }}
```
{: .language-bash}

{% include {{ site.snippets }}/scheduler/runtime-exceeded-job.snip %}

{% include {{ site.snippets }}/scheduler/runtime-exceeded-output.snip %}

Our job was killed for exceeding the amount of resources it requested. Although
this appears harsh, this is actually a feature. Strict adherence to resource
requests allows the scheduler to find the best possible place for your jobs.
Even more importantly, it ensures that another user cannot use more resources
than they've been given. If another user messes up and accidentally attempts to
use all of the cores or memory on a node, {{ site.sched.name }} will either
restrain their job to the requested resources or kill the job outright. Other
jobs on the node will be unaffected. This means that one user cannot mess up
the experience of others, the only jobs affected by a mistake in scheduling
will be their own.

## Cancelling a job

Sometimes we'll make a mistake and need to cancel a job. This can be done with
the `{{ site.sched.del }}` command. Let's submit a job and then cancel it using
its job number (remember to change the walltime so that it runs long enough for
you to cancel it before it is killed!).

```
{{ site.remote.prompt }} {{ site.sched.submit.name }} {{ site.sched.submit.options }} example-job.sh
{{ site.remote.prompt }} {{ site.sched.status }} {{ site.sched.flag.user }}
```
{: .language-bash}

{% include {{ site.snippets }}/scheduler/terminate-job-begin.snip %}

Now cancel the job with its job number (printed in your terminal). A clean
return of your command prompt indicates that the request to cancel the job was
successful.

```
{{ site.remote.prompt }} {{site.sched.del }} 38759
# It might take a minute for the job to disappear from the queue...
{{ site.remote.prompt }} {{ site.sched.status }} {{ site.sched.flag.user }}
```
{: .language-bash}

{% include {{ site.snippets }}/scheduler/terminate-job-cancel.snip %}

{% include {{ site.snippets }}/scheduler/terminate-multiple-jobs.snip %}

## Other types of jobs

Up to this point, we've focused on running jobs in batch mode.
{{ site.sched.name }} also provides the ability to start an interactive session.

There are very frequently tasks that need to be done interactively. Creating an
entire job script might be overkill, but the amount of resources required is
too much for a login node to handle. A good example of this might be building a
genome index for alignment with a tool like
[HISAT2](https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/hisat2/index.shtml). Fortunately, we can
run these types of tasks as a one-off with `{{ site.sched.interactive }}`.
