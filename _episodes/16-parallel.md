We now have the tools we need to run a multi-processor job. This is a very important
aspect of HPC systems, as parallelism is one of the primary tools we have to improve the
performance of computational tasks.

## Running the Parallel Job

We will run an example that uses the Message Passing Interface (MPI) for parallelism &mdash;
this is a common tool on HPC systems.

MPI jobs cannot generally be run as stand-alone executables. Instead, they should be
started with the `mpirun` command, which ensures that the appropriate run-time support for
parallelism is included.

On its own, `mpirun` can take many arguments specifying how many machines will participate
in the process. In the context of our queuing system, however, we do not need to specify
this information, the `mpirun` command will obtain it from the queuing system, by
examining the environment variables set when the job is launched.

Our example implements a stochastic algorithm for estimating the value of &#960;, the
ratio of the circumference to the diameter of a circle. The program generates a large
number of random points on a 1&times;1 square centered on (&frac12;,&frac12;), and checks
how many of these points fall inside the unit circle. On average, &#960;/4 of the
randomly-selected points should fall in the circle, so &#960; can be estimated from 4*f*,
where *f* is the observed fraction of points that fall in the circle. Because each sample
is independent, this algorithm is easily implemented in parallel.

We have provided a Python implementation, which uses MPI and NumPy, a popular library for
efficient numerical operations.

Download the Python executable using the following command:

```
{{ site.remote.prompt }} wget {{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/files/pi.py
```
{: .bash}

Let's take a quick look inside the file. It is richly commented, and should explain itself
clearly. Press "q" to exit the pager program (`less`).

```
{{ site.remote.prompt }} less pi.py
```
{: .bash}

In general, achieving a better estimate of Ï€ requires a greater number of points. Take a
closer look at `inside_circle`: should we expect to get high accuracy on a single
machine?

Probably not. The function allocates two arrays of size *N* equal to the number of points
belonging to this process. Using 32-bit floating point numbers, the memory footprint of
these arrays can get quite large. The default total number &mdash; 8,738,128 &mdash; was
selected to achieve a 100 MB memory footprint. Pushing this number to a billion yields a
memory footprint of 11.2 GB: if your machine has less RAM than that, it will grind
to a halt. If you have 16 GB installed, you won't quite make it to 1&frac12; billion points.

Our purpose here is to exercise the parallel workflow of the cluster, not to optimize the
program to minimize its memory footprint. Rather than push our local machines to the
breaking point (or, worse, the login node), let's give it to a cluster node with more
resources. 

Create a submission file, requesting more than one task on a single node:

```
{{ site.remote.prompt }} nano parallel-pi.sh
{{ site.remote.prompt }} cat parallel-pi.sh
```
{: .bash}

```
#!/bin/bash
{{ site.sched.comment }} {{ site.sched.flag.name }} parallel-pi
{{ site.sched.comment }} {{ site.sched.flag.queue }} {{ site.sched.queue.testing }}
{% include {{ site.snippets }}/parallel/four-tasks.snip %}
module load python3
mpirun ./pi.py 1431652028
```
{: .output}

Then submit your job. We will use the batch file to set the options,
rather than the command line.

```
{{ site.remote.prompt }} {{ site.sched.submit.name }} parallel-pi.sh
```
{: .bash}

As before, use the status commands to check when your job runs. Use `ls` to locate the
output file, and examine it. Is it what you expected?

* How good is the value for &#960;?
* How much memory did it need?
* How much of that memory was used on each node?
