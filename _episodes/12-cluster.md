## What Is an HPC System?

The words "cloud", "cluster", and the phrase "high-performance computing" or
"HPC" are used a lot in different contexts and with various related meanings.
So what do they mean? And more importantly, how do we use them in our work?

The *cloud* is a generic term commonly used to refer to computing resources
that are a) *provisioned* to users on demand or as needed and b) represent real
or *virtual* resources that may be located anywhere on Earth. For example, a
large company with computing resources in Brazil, Zimbabwe and Japan may manage
those resources as its own *internal* cloud and that same company may also
use commercial cloud resources provided by Amazon or Google. Cloud
resources may refer to machines performing relatively simple tasks such as
serving websites, providing shared storage, providing web services (such as
e-mail or social media platforms), as well as more traditional compute
intensive tasks such as running a simulation.

The term *HPC system*, on the other hand, describes a stand-alone resource for
computationally intensive workloads. They are typically comprised of a
multitude of integrated processing and storage elements, designed to handle
high volumes of data and/or large numbers of floating-point operations
([FLOPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FLOPS)) with the highest possible
performance. For example, all of the machines on the
[Top-500](https://www.top500.org) list are HPC systems. To support these
constraints, an HPC resource must exist in a specific, fixed location:
networking cables can only stretch so far, and electrical and optical signals
can travel only so fast.

The word "cluster" is often used for small to moderate scale HPC resources less
impressive than the [Top-500](https://www.top500.org). Clusters are often
maintained in computing centers that support several such systems, all sharing
common networking and storage to support common compute intensive tasks.

## Secure Connections

The first step in using a cluster is to establish a connection from our laptop
to the cluster. When we are sitting at a computer (or standing, or holding it
in our hands or on our wrists), we have come to expect a visual display with
icons, widgets, and perhaps some windows or applications: a graphical user
interface, or GUI. Since computer clusters are remote resources that we connect
to over often slow or laggy interfaces (WiFi and VPNs especially), it is more
practical to use a command-line interface, or CLI, in which commands and
results are transmitted via text, only. Anything other than text (images, for
example) must be written to disk and opened with a separate program.

If you have ever opened the Windows Command Prompt or macOS Terminal, you have
seen a CLI. If you have already taken The Carpentries' courses on the UNIX
Shell or Version Control, you have used the CLI on your local machine somewhat
extensively. The only leap to be made here is to open a CLI on a *remote*
machine, while taking some precautions so that other folks on the network can't
see (or change) the commands you're running or the results the remote machine
sends back. We will use the Secure SHell protocol (or SSH) to open an encrypted
network connection between two machines, allowing you to send & receive text
and data without having to worry about prying eyes.

   alt="Connect to cluster" caption="" %}

SSH clients are usually command-line tools, where you provide the remote
machine address as the only required argument. If your username on the remote
system differs from what you use locally, you must provide that as well. If
your SSH client has a graphical front-end, such as PuTTY or MobaXterm, you will
set these arguments before clicking "connect." From the terminal, you'll write
something like `ssh userName@hostname`, where the argument is just like an
email address: the "@" symbol is used to separate the personal ID from the
address of the shared resource.

When logging in to a laptop, tablet, or other personal device, a username,
password, or pattern are normally required to prevent unauthorized access. In
these situations, the likelihood of somebody else intercepting your password is
low, since logging your keystrokes requires a malicious exploit or physical
access. For systems like {{ site.remote.host }} running an SSH server, anybody
on the network can log in, or try to. Since usernames are often public or easy
to guess, your password is often the weakest link in the security chain. Many
clusters therefore forbid password-based login, requiring instead that you
generate and configure a public-private key pair with a much stronger password.
Even if your cluster does not require it, the next section will guide you
through the use of SSH keys and an SSH agent to both strengthen your security
*and* make it more convenient to log in to remote systems.

### Better Security With SSH Keys

The [Lesson Setup]({{ page.root }}/setup) provides instructions for installing
a shell application with SSH. If you have not done so already, please open that
shell application with a Unix-like command line interface to your system.

SSH keys are an alternative method for authentication to obtain access to
remote computing systems. They can also be used for authentication when
transferring files or for accessing version control systems. In this section
you will create a pair of SSH keys:

* a private key which you keep on your own computer, and
* a public key which can be placed on any remote system you will access.

> ## Private keys are your secure digital passport
>
> A private key that is visible to anyone but you should be considered
> compromised, and must be destroyed. This includes having improper permissions
> on the directory it (or a copy) is stored in, traversing any network that is
> not secure (encrypted), attachment on unencrypted email, and even displaying
> the key on your terminal window.
>
> Protect this key as if it unlocks your front door. In many ways, it does.
{: .caution}

#### SSH Keys on Linux, Mac, MobaXterm, and Windows Subsystem for Linux

Once you have opened a terminal, check for existing SSH keys and filenames
since existing SSH keys are overwritten.

```
{{ site.local.prompt }} ls ~/.ssh/
```
{: .language-bash}

If `~/.ssh/id_ed25519` already exists, you will need to choose a different name
for the new key-pair.

Generate a new public-private key pair using the following command, which will
produce a stronger key than the `ssh-keygen` default by invoking these flags:

* `-a` (default is 16): number of rounds of passphrase derivation; increase to
  slow down brute force attacks.
* `-t` (default is [rsa][wiki-rsa]): specify the "type" or cryptographic
  algorithm. `ed25519` specifies [EdDSA][wiki-dsa] with a 256-bit key;
  it is faster than RSA with a comparable strength.
* `-f` (default is /home/user/.ssh/id_algorithm): filename to store your
  private key. The public key will be identical, with a `.pub` extension added.

```
{{ site.local.prompt }} ssh-keygen -a 100 -f ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 -t ed25519
```
{: .language-bash}

When prompted, enter a strong password that you will remember. There are two
common approaches to this:

1. Create a memorable passphrase with some punctuation and number-for-letter
   substitutions, 32 characters or longer. Street addresses work well; just be
   careful of social engineering or public records attacks.
2. Use a password manager and its built-in password generator with all
   character classes, 25 characters or longer. KeePass and BitWarden are two
   good options.

Note that the terminal will not appear to change while you type the password:
this is deliberate, for your security. You will be prompted to type it again,
so don't worry too much about typos.

Take a look in `~/.ssh` (use `ls ~/.ssh`). You should see two new files:

* your private key (`~/.ssh/id_ed25519`): *do not share with anyone!*
* the shareable public key (`~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub`): if a system administrator
  asks for a key, this is the one to send. It is also safe to upload to
  websites such as GitHub: it is meant to be seen.

> ## No Empty Passwords
>
> Nothing is *less* secure than a private key with no password. If you skipped
> password entry by accident, go back and generate a new key pair *with* a
> strong password.
{: .warning}

##### Use RSA for Older Systems

If key generation failed because ed25519 is not available, try using the older
(but still strong and trustworthy) [RSA][wiki-rsa] cryptosystem. Again, first
check for an existing key:

```
{{ site.local.prompt }} ls ~/.ssh/
```
{: .language-bash}

If `~/.ssh/id_rsa` already exists, you will need to choose a different name
for the new key-pair. Generate it as above, with the following extra flags:

* `-b` sets the number of bits in the key. The default is 2048.
  EdDSA uses a fixed key length, so this flag would have no effect.
* `-o` (no default): use the OpenSSH key format,
  rather than PEM.

```
{{ site.local.prompt }} ssh-keygen -a 100 -b 4096 -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa -o -t rsa
```
{: .language-bash}

When prompted, enter a strong password that you will remember. There are two
common approaches to this:

1. Create a memorable passphrase with some punctuation and number-for-letter
   substitutions, 32 characters or longer. Street addresses work well; just be
   careful of social engineering or public records attacks.
2. Use a password manager and its built-in password generator with all
   character classes, 25 characters or longer. KeePass and BitWarden are two
   good options.

Take a look in `~/.ssh` (use `ls ~/.ssh`). You should see two new files:

* your private key (`~/.ssh/id_ed25519`): *do not share with anyone!*
* the shareable public key (`~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub`): if a system administrator
  asks for a key, this is the one to send. It is also safe to upload to
  websites such as GitHub: it is meant to be seen.

#### SSH Keys on PuTTY

If you are using PuTTY on Windows, download and use `puttygen` to generate the
key pair. See the [PuTTY documentation][putty-gen] for details.

* Select `EdDSA` as the key type.
* Select `255` as the key size or strength.
* Click on the "Generate" button.
* You do not need to enter a comment.
* When prompted, enter a strong password that you will remember. There are two
  common approaches to this:

1. Create a memorable passphrase with some punctuation and number-for-letter
   substitutions, 32 characters or longer. Street addresses work well; just be
   careful of social engineering or public records attacks.
2. Use a password manager and its built-in password generator with all
   character classes, 25 characters or longer. KeePass and BitWarden are two
   good options.

* Save the keys in a folder no other users of the system can read.

Take a look in the folder you specified. You should see two new files:

* your private key (`id_ed25519`): *do not share with anyone!*
* the shareable public key (`id_ed25519.pub`): if a system administrator
  asks for a key, this is the one to send. It is also safe to upload to
  websites such as GitHub: it is meant to be seen.

### SSH Agent for Easier Key Handling

An SSH key is only as strong as the password used to unlock it, but on the
other hand, typing out a complex password every time you connect to a machine
is tedious and gets old very fast. This is where the [SSH Agent][ssh-agent]
comes in.

Using an SSH Agent, you can type your password for the private key once, then
have the Agent remember for some number of hours or until you log off. Unless
some nefarious actor has physical access to your machine, this keeps the
password safe, and removes the tedium of entering the password multiple times.

Just remember your password, because once it expires in the Agent, you have to
type it in again.

#### SSH Agents on Linux, macOS, and Windows

Open your terminal application and check if an agent is running:

```
{{ site.local.prompt }} ssh-add -l
```
{: .language-bash}

* If you get an error like this one,

  ```
  Error connecting to agent: No such file or directory
  ```
  {: .error}

  ... then you need to launch the agent *as a background process*.

  ```
  {{ site.local.prompt }} eval $(ssh-agent)
  ```
  {: .language-bash}

* Otherwise, your agent is already running: don't mess with it.

Add your key to the agent, with session expiration after 8 hours:

```
{{ site.local.prompt }} ssh-add -t 8h ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```
{: .language-bash}
```
Enter passphrase for .ssh/id_ed25519: 
Identity added: .ssh/id_ed25519
Lifetime set to 86400 seconds
```
{: .output}

For the duration (8 hours), whenever you use that key, the SSH Agent will
provide the key on your behalf without you having to type a single keystroke.

#### SSH Agent on PuTTY

If you are using PuTTY on Windows, download and use `pageant` as the SSH agent.
See the [PuTTY documentation][putty-agent].

### Transfer Your Public Key

{% if site.remote.portal %}
Visit {{ site.remote.portal }} to upload your SSH public key.
{% else %}
Use the **s**ecure **c**o**p**y tool to send your public key to the cluster.

```
{{ site.local.prompt }} scp ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub {{ site.remote.user }}@{{ site.remote.login }}:~/
```
{: .language-bash}
{% endif %}

## Log In to the Cluster

Go ahead and open your terminal or graphical SSH client, then log in to the
cluster. Replace `{{ site.remote.user }}` with your username or the one
supplied by the instructors.

```
{{ site.local.prompt }} ssh {{ site.remote.user }}@{{ site.remote.login }}
```
{: .language-bash}

You may be asked for your password. Watch out: the characters you type after
the password prompt are not displayed on the screen. Normal output will resume
once you press `Enter`.

You may have noticed that the prompt changed when you logged into the remote
system using the terminal (if you logged in using PuTTY this will not apply
because it does not offer a local terminal). This change is important because
it can help you distinguish on which system the commands you type will be run
when you pass them into the terminal. This change is also a small complication
that we will need to navigate throughout the workshop. Exactly what is reported
before the `$` in the terminal when it is connected to the local system and the
remote system will typically be different for every user. We still need to
indicate which system we are entering commands on though so we will adopt the
following convention:

- `{{ site.local.prompt }}` when the command is to be entered on a terminal
  connected to your local computer
- `{{ site.remote.prompt }}` when the command is to be entered on a
  terminal connected to the remote system
- `$` when it really doesn't matter which system the terminal is connected to.

## Looking Around Your Remote Home

Very often, many users are tempted to think of a high-performance computing
installation as one giant, magical machine. Sometimes, people will assume that
the computer they've logged onto is the entire computing cluster. So what's
really happening? What computer have we logged on to? The name of the current
computer we are logged onto can be checked with the `hostname` command. (You
may also notice that the current hostname is also part of our prompt!)

```
{{ site.remote.prompt }} hostname
```
{: .language-bash}

```
{{ site.remote.host }}
```
{: .output}

So, we're definitely on the remote machine. Next, let's find out where we are
by running `pwd` to **p**rint the **w**orking **d**irectory.

```
{{ site.remote.prompt }} pwd
```
{: .language-bash}

```
{{ site.remote.homedir }}/{{ site.remote.user }}
```
{: .output}

Great, we know where we are! Let's see what's in our current directory:

```
{{ site.remote.prompt }} ls
```
{: .language-bash}

The system administrators may have configured your home directory with some
helpful files, folders, and links (shortcuts) to space reserved for you on
other filesystems. If they did not, your home directory may appear empty. To
double-check, include hidden files in your directory listing:

```
{{ site.remote.prompt }} ls -a
```
{: .language-bash}
```
  .            .bashrc           id_ed25519.pub
  ..           .ssh
```
{: .output}

In the first column, `.` is a reference to the current directory and `..` a
reference to its parent (`{{ site.remote.homedir }}`). You may or may not see
the other files, or files like them: `.bashrc` is a shell configuration file,
which you can edit with your preferences; and `.ssh` is a directory storing SSH
keys and a record of authorized connections.

### Install Your SSH Key

If you transferred your SSH public key with `scp`, you should see
`id_ed25519.pub` in your home directory. To "install" this key, it must be
listed in a file named `authorized_keys` under the `.ssh` folder.

If the `.ssh` folder was not listed above, then it does not yet exist: create it.

```
{{ site.remote.prompt }} mkdir ~/.ssh
```
{: .language-bash}

Now, use `cat` to print your public key, but redirect the output, appending it
to the `authorized_keys` file:

```
{{ site.remote.prompt }} cat ~/id_ed25519.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```
{: .language-bash}

That's all! Disconnect, then try to log back into the remote: if your key and
agent have been configured correctly, you should not be prompted for a password.

```
{{ site.remote.prompt }} logout
```
{: .language-bash}

```
{{ site.local.prompt }}  ssh {{ site.remote.user }}@{{ site.remote.login }}
```
{: .language-bash}


```
{{ site.remote.prompt }} ls
```
{: .language-bash}

## Look Around the Rest of the System

Most high-performance computing systems run the Linux operating system, which
is built around the UNIX [Filesystem Hierarchy Standard][fshs]. Instead of
having a separate root for each hard drive or storage medium, all files and
devices are anchored to the "root" directory, which is `/`:

```
{{ site.remote.prompt }} ls /
```
{: .language-bash}
{% include {{ site.snippets }}/cluster/root-folders.snip %}

The "home" directory is the one where we generally want to keep all of our
files. Other folders on a UNIX OS contain system files, and get modified and
changed as you install new software or upgrade your OS.

## Nodes

Individual computers that compose a cluster are typically called *nodes*
(although you will also hear people call them *servers*, *computers* and
*machines*). On a cluster, there are different types of nodes for different
types of tasks. The node where you are right now is called the *head node*,
*login node*, *landing pad*, or *submit node*. A login node serves as an access
point to the cluster.

As a gateway, it is well suited for uploading and downloading files, setting up
software, and running quick tests. Generally speaking, the login node should
not be used for time-consuming or resource-intensive tasks. You should be alert
to this, and check with your site's operators or documentation for details of
what is and isn't allowed. In these lessons, we will avoid running jobs on the
head node.

> ## Dedicated Transfer Nodes
>
> If you want to transfer larger amounts of data to or from the cluster, some
> systems offer dedicated nodes for data transfers only. The motivation for
> this lies in the fact that larger data transfers should not obstruct
> operation of the login node for anybody else. Check with your cluster's
> documentation or its support team if such a transfer node is available. As a
> rule of thumb, consider all transfers of a volume larger than 500 MB to 1 GB
> as large. But these numbers change, e.g., depending on the network connection
> of yourself and of your cluster or other factors.
{: .callout}

The real work on a cluster gets done by the *worker* (or *compute*) *nodes*.
Worker nodes come in many shapes and sizes, but generally are dedicated to long
or hard tasks that require a lot of computational resources.

All interaction with the worker nodes is handled by a specialized piece of
software called a scheduler (the scheduler used in this lesson is called
{{ site.sched.name }}). We'll learn more about how to use the
scheduler to submit jobs next, but for now, it can also tell us more
information about the worker nodes.

For example, we can view all of the worker nodes by running the command
`{{ site.sched.info }}`.

```
{{ site.remote.prompt }} {{ site.sched.info }}
```
{: .language-bash}

{% include {{ site.snippets }}/cluster/queue-info.snip %}

There are also specialized machines used for managing disk storage, user
authentication, and other infrastructure-related tasks. Although we do not
typically logon to or interact with these machines directly, they enable a
number of key features like ensuring our user account and files are available
throughout the HPC system.

## What's in a Node?

All of the nodes in an HPC system have the same components as your own laptop
or desktop: *CPUs* (sometimes also called *processors* or *cores*), *memory*
(or *RAM*), and *disk* space. CPUs are a computer's tool for actually running
programs and calculations. Information about a current task is stored in the
computer's memory. Disk refers to all storage that can be accessed like a file
system. This is generally storage that can hold data permanently, i.e. data is
still there even if the computer has been restarted. While this storage can be
local (a hard drive installed inside of it), it is more common for nodes to
connect to a shared, remote fileserver or cluster of servers.

With all of this in mind, we will now cover how to talk to the cluster's
scheduler, and use it to start running our scripts and programs!
