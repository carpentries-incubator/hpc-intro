## Look Around the Remote System

If you have not already connected to {{ site.remote.name }}, please do so now:

```
{{ site.local.prompt }}  ssh {{ site.remote.user }}@{{ site.remote.login }}
```
{: .language-bash}

Take a look at your home directory on the remote system:

```
{{ site.remote.prompt }} ls
```
{: .language-bash}

Most high-performance computing systems run the Linux operating system, which
is built around the UNIX [Filesystem Hierarchy Standard][fshs]. Instead of
having a separate root for each hard drive or storage medium, all files and
devices are anchored to the "root" directory, which is `/`:

```
{{ site.remote.prompt }} ls /
```
{: .language-bash}
```
bin   etc   lib64  proc  sbin     sys  var
boot  bask  mnt    root  scratch  tmp  working
dev   lib   opt    run   srv      usr
```
{: .output}

The `{{ site.remote.homedir }}` directory is the one where
we generally want to keep all of our files (Note: on Baskerville, the last letter of the directory corresponds to the first letter of your username). Other folders on a UNIX OS contain
system files and change as you install new software or upgrade your OS.

> ## Using HPC filesystems
>
> On HPC systems, you have a number of places where you can store your files.
> These differ in both the amount of space allocated and whether or not they
> are backed up.
>
> * __Home__ -- often a _network filesystem_, data stored here is available
>   throughout the HPC system, and often backed up periodically. Files stored
>   here are typically slower to access, the data is actually stored on another
>   computer and is being transmitted and made available over the network!
> * __Scratch__ -- typically faster than the networked Home directory, but not
>   usually backed up, and should not be used for long term storage.
> * __Work__ -- sometimes provided as an alternative to Scratch space, Work is
>   a fast file system accessed over the network. Typically, this will have
>   higher performance than your home directory, but lower performance than
>   Scratch; it may not be backed up. It differs from Scratch space in that
>   files in a work file system are not automatically deleted for you: you must
>   manage the space yourself.

## Nodes

Individual computers that compose a cluster are typically called _nodes_
(although you will also hear people call them _servers_, _computers_ and
_machines_). On a cluster, there are different types of nodes for different
types of tasks. The node where you are right now is called the _login node_,
_head node_, _landing pad_, or _submit node_. A login node serves as an access
point to the cluster.

As a gateway, the login node should not be used for time-consuming or
resource-intensive tasks. You should be alert to this, and check with your
site's operators or documentation for details of what is and isn't allowed. It
is well suited for uploading and downloading files, setting up software, and
running tests. Generally speaking, in these lessons, we will avoid running jobs
on the login node.

Who else is logged in to the login node?

```
{{ site.remote.prompt }} who
```
{: .language-bash}

This may show only your user ID, but there are likely several other people
(including fellow learners) connected right now.

> ## Dedicated Transfer Nodes
>
> If you want to transfer larger amounts of data to or from the cluster, some
> systems offer dedicated nodes for data transfers only. The motivation for
> this lies in the fact that larger data transfers should not obstruct
> operation of the login node for anybody else. Check with your cluster's
> documentation or its support team if such a transfer node is available. As a
> rule of thumb, consider all transfers of a volume larger than 500 MB to 1 GB
> as large. But these numbers change, e.g., depending on the network connection
> of yourself and of your cluster or other factors.
{: .callout}

The real work on a cluster gets done by the _compute_ (or _worker_) _nodes_.
compute nodes come in many shapes and sizes, but generally are dedicated to long
or hard tasks that require a lot of computational resources.

All interaction with the compute nodes is handled by a specialized piece of
software called a scheduler (the scheduler used in this lesson is called
{{ site.sched.name }}). We'll learn more about how to use the
scheduler to submit jobs next, but for now, it can also tell us more
information about the compute nodes.

For example, we can view all of the compute nodes by running the command
`{{ site.sched.info }}` (Note: command not available on Baskerville).

```
{{ site.remote.prompt }} {{ site.sched.info }}
```
{: .language-bash}

{% include {{ site.snippets }}/cluster/queue-info.snip %}

A lot of the nodes are busy running work for other users: we are not alone
here!

There are also specialized machines used for managing disk storage, user
authentication, and other infrastructure-related tasks. Although we do not
typically logon to or interact with these machines directly, they enable a
number of key features like ensuring our user account and files are available
throughout the HPC system.

## What's in a Node?

All of the nodes in an HPC system have the same components as your own laptop
or desktop: _CPUs_ (sometimes also called _processors_ or _cores_), _memory_
(or _RAM_), and _disk_ space. CPUs are a computer's tool for actually running
programs and calculations. Information about a current task is stored in the
computer's memory. Disk refers to all storage that can be accessed like a file
system. This is generally storage that can hold data permanently, i.e. data is
still there even if the computer has been restarted. While this storage can be
local (a hard drive installed inside of it), it is more common for nodes to
connect to a shared, remote fileserver or cluster of servers.

With all of this in mind, we will now cover how to talk to the cluster's
scheduler, and use it to start running our scripts and programs!
