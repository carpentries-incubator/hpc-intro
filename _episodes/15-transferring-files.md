Computing with a remote computer offers very limited use if we cannot get files to or from the
cluster. There are several options for transferring data between computing resources, from command
line options to GUI programs, which we will cover here.

## Download files from the internet using wget

One of the most straightforward ways to download files is to use `wget`. Any file that can be
downloaded in your web browser with an accessible link can be downloaded using `wget`. This is a
quick way to download datasets or source code.

The syntax is: `wget https://some/link/to/a/file.tar.gz`. For example, download the lesson sample
files using the following command:

```
{{ site.remote.prompt }} wget {{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/files/bash-lesson.tar.gz
```
{: .bash}

## Transferring single files and folders with scp

To copy a single file to or from the cluster, we can use `scp` ("secure copy"). The syntax can be
a little complex for new users, but we'll break it down.

To transfer *to* another computer:
```
{{ site.local.prompt }} scp path/to/local/file.txt {{ site.remote.user }}@{{ site.remote.login }}:path/on/{{ site.remote.name }}
```
{: .bash}

> ## Transfer a file
>
> Create a "calling card" with your name and email address, then transfer it to your home directory
> on {{ site.remote.name }}.
>
> > ## Solution
> > 
> > Create a file like this, with your name (or an alias) and top-level domain:
> >
> > ```
> > {{ site.local.prompt }} cat calling-card.txt
> > ```
> > {: .bash}
> >
> > ```
> > Your Name
> > Your.Address@institution.tld
> > ```
> > {: .output}
> >
> > Now, transfer it to {{ site.remote.name }}:
> >
> > ```
> > {{ site.local.prompt }} scp calling-card.txt {{ site.remote.user }}@{{ site.remote.login }}:~/
> > ```
> > {: .bash}
> >
> > ```
> > calling-card.txt                                                 100%   37     7.6 KB/s   00:00

To download *from* another computer:
```
{{ site.local.prompt }} scp {{ site.remote.user }}@{{ site.remote.login }}:path/on/{{ site.remote.name }}/file.txt path/to/local/
```
{: .bash}

Note that we can simplify doing this by shortening our paths. On the remote computer, everything
after the `:` is relative to our home directory. We can simply just add a `:` and leave it at that
if we don't care where the file goes.

```
{{ site.local.prompt }} scp local-file.txt {{ site.remote.user }}@{{ site.remote.login }}:
```
{: .bash}

To recursively copy a directory, we just add the `-r` (recursive) flag:

```
{{ site.local.prompt }} scp -r some-local-folder {{ site.remote.user }}@{{ site.remote.login }}:target-directory/
```
{: .bash}

This will create the directory 'some-local-folder' on the remote system, 
and recursively copy all the content from the local to the remote system.
Existing files on the remote system will not be modified, unless
there are files from the local system with the same name, in which
case the remote files will be overwritten.

A trailing slash on the target directory is optional, and has no
effect for `scp -r`, but is important in other commands, like `rsync`.

> ## A note on `rsync`
>
> As you gain experience with transferring files, you may find the `scp` command limiting. The
> [rsync](https://rsync.samba.org/) utility provides advanced features for file transfer and is
> typically faster compared to both `scp` and `sftp` (see below). It is especially useful for
> transferring large and/or many files and creating synced backup folders.
>
> The syntax is similar to `scp`. To transfer *to* another computer with commonly used options:
>
> ```
> {{ site.local.prompt }} rsync -avzP path/to/local/file.txt {{ site.remote.user }}@{{ site.remote.login }}:directory/path/on/{{ site.remote.name }}/
> ```
> {: .bash}
>
> The `a` (archive) option preserves file timestamps and permissions among other things; the `v`
> (verbose) option gives verbose output to help monitor the transfer; the `z` (compression) option
> compresses the file during transit to reduce size and transfer time; and the `P`
> (partial/progress) option preserves partially transferred files in case of an interruption and
> also displays the progress of the transfer.
>
> To recursively copy a directory, we can use the same options:
>
> ```
> {{ site.local.prompt }} rsync -avzP path/to/local/dir {{ site.remote.user }}@{{ site.remote.login }}:directory/path/on/{{ site.remote.name }}/
> ```
> {: .bash}
> 
> As written, this will place the local directory and its contents under the 
> specified directory on the remote system. If the trailing slash is
> omitted on the destination, a new directory corresponding to the
> transferred directory ('dir' in the example) will not be created, 
> and the contents of the source directory will be copied directly into 
> the destination directory. 
> 
> The `a` (archive) option implies recursion.
> 
> To download a file, we simply change the source and destination:
>
> ```
> {{ site.local.prompt }} rsync -avzP {{ site.remote.user }}@{{ site.remote.login }}:path/on/{{ site.remote.name }}/file.txt path/to/local/
> ```
> {: .bash}
{: .callout}

## Transferring files interactively with FileZilla

FileZilla is a cross-platform client for downloading and uploading files to and from a remote
computer. It is absolutely fool-proof and always works quite well. It uses the `sftp` protocol. You
can read more about using the `sftp` protocol in the command line [here]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link
_extras/discuss.md %}).

Download and install the FileZilla client from
[https://filezilla-project.org](https://filezilla-project.org). After installing and opening the
program, you should end up with a window with a file browser of your local system on the left hand
side of the screen. When you connect to the cluster, your cluster files will appear on the right
hand side.

To connect to the cluster, we'll just need to enter our credentials at the top of the screen:

* Host: `sftp://{{ site.remote.login }}`
* User: Your cluster username
* Password: Your cluster password
* Port: (leave blank to use the default port)

Hit "Quickconnect" to connect. You should see your remote files appear on the right hand side of the
screen. You can drag-and-drop files between the left (local) and right (remote) sides of the screen
to transfer files. 

Finally, if you need to move large files (typically larger than a gigabyte) from one remote computer to another remote computer, SSH in to the computer hosting the files and use `scp` or `rsync` to transfer over to the other. This will be more efficient than using FileZilla (or related applications) that would copy from the source to your local machine, then to the destination machine.

## Archiving files

One of the biggest challenges we often face when transferring data between remote HPC systems
is that of large numbers of files. There is an overhead to transferring each individual file 
and when we are transferring large numbers of files these overheads combine to slow down our
transfers to a large degree.

The solution to this problem is to *archive* multiple files into smaller numbers of larger files
before we transfer the data to improve our transfer efficiency. Sometimes we will combine 
archiving with *compression* to reduce the amount of data we have to transfer and so speed up
the transfer.

The most common archiving command you will use on a (Linux) HPC cluster is `tar`. `tar` can be used
to combine files into a single archive file and, optionally, compress. For example, to collect
all files contained inside `output_data` into an archive file called `output_data.tar` we would use:

```
{{ site.local.prompt }} tar -cvf output_data.tar output_data/
```
{: .bash}

The options we used for `tar` are:

- `-c` - Create new archive
- `-v` - Verbose (print what you are doing!)
- `-f mydata.tar` - Create the archive in file *output_data.tar*

The tar command allows users to concatenate flags. Instead of typing `tar -c -v -f`, we can use
`tar -cvf`. 

The `tar` command can also be used to interrogate and unpack archive files. The `-t` argument 
("**t**able of contents") lists the contents of the referred-to file without unpacking it.  
The `-x` ("e**x**tract") flag unpacks the referred-to file.  To unpack the file after we have 
transferred it:

```
{{ site.local.prompt }} tar -xvf output_data.tar
```
{: .bash}

This will put the data into a directory called `output_data`. Be careful, it will overwrite data
there if this directory already exists!

Sometimes you may also want to compress the archive to save space and speed up the transfer.
However, you should be aware that for large amounts of data compressing and un-compressing can take
longer than transferring the un-compressed data so you may not want to transfer. To create a
compressed archive using `tar` we add the `-z` option and add the `.gz` extension to the file to
indicate it is `gzip`-compressed, e.g.:

```
{{ site.local.prompt }} tar -czvf output_data.tar.gz output_data/
```
{: .bash}

The `tar` command is used to extract the files from the archive in exactly the same way as for
uncompressed data. The `tar` command recognizes that the data is compressed, and automatically 
selects the correct decompression algorithm at the time of extraction:

```
{{ site.local.prompt }} tar -xvf output_data.tar.gz
```
{: .bash}
