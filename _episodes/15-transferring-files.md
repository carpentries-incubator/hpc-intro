Computing with a remote computer offers very limited use if we cannot get files
to or from the cluster. There are several options for transferring data between
computing resources, from command line options to GUI programs, which we will
cover here.

## Download files from the Internet

One of the most straightforward ways to download files is to use `wget`. Any
file that can be downloaded in your web browser through a direct link can be
downloaded using `wget`. This is a quick way to download datasets or source
code.

The syntax is: `wget https://some/link/to/a/file`. Try it out by downloading
some material we'll use later on, from a terminal on your local machine.

```
{{ site.local.prompt }} wget {{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/files/hpc-intro-data.tar.gz
```
{: .language-bash}

> ## `tar.gz`?
>
> This is an archive file format, just like `.zip`, commonly used and supported
> by default on Linux, which is the operating system the majority of HPC
> cluster machines run. You may also see the extension `.tgz`, which is exactly
> the same. We'll talk more about "tarballs," since "tar-dot-g-z" is a
> mouthful, later on.

## Transferring single files and folders with scp

To copy a single file to or from the cluster, we can use `scp` ("secure copy").
The syntax can be a little complex for new users, but we'll break it down.

To *upload to* another computer:

```
{{ site.local.prompt }} scp path/to/local/file.txt {{ site.remote.user }}@{{ site.remote.login }}:/path/on/{{ site.remote.name }}
```
{: .language-bash}

To *download from* another computer:

```
{{ site.local.prompt }} scp {{ site.remote.user }}@{{ site.remote.login }}:/path/on/{{ site.remote.name }}/file.txt path/to/local/
```
{: .language-bash}

Note that everything after the `:` is relative to our home directory on the
remote computer. We can leave it at that if we don't care where the file goes.

```
{{ site.local.prompt }} scp local-file.txt {{ site.remote.user }}@{{ site.remote.login }}:
```
{: .language-bash}

> ## Upload a file

To copy a whole directory, we add the `-r` flag, for "**r**ecursive": copy the
item specified, and every item below it, and every item below those... until it
reaches the bottom of the directory tree rooted at the folder name you
provided.

```
{{ site.local.prompt }} scp -r some-local-folder {{ site.remote.user }}@{{ site.remote.login }}:target-directory/
```
{: .language-bash}

> For a large directory &mdash; either in size or number of files &mdash;

## What's in a `/`?

When using `scp`, you may have noticed that a `:` *always* follows the remote
computer name; sometimes a `/` follows that, and sometimes not, and sometimes
there's a final `/`. On Linux computers, `/` is the ***root*** directory, the
location where the entire filesystem (and others attached to it) is anchored. A
path starting with a `/` is called *absolute*, since there can be nothing above
the root `/`. A path that does not start with `/` is called *relative*, since
it is not anchored to the root.

If you want to upload a file to a location inside your home directory &mdash;
which is often the case &mdash; then you don't need a leading `/`. After the
`:`, start writing the sequence of folders that lead to the final storage
location for the file or, as mentioned above, provide nothing if your home
directory *is* the destination.

A trailing slash on the target directory is optional, and has no effect for
`scp -r`, but is important in other commands, like `rsync`.

> ## A note on `rsync`

> As you gain experience with transferring files, you may find the `scp`
> command limiting. The [rsync](https://rsync.samba.org/) utility provides
> advanced features for file transfer and is typically faster compared to both
> `scp` and `sftp` (see below). It is especially useful for transferring large

> ```
> {{ site.local.prompt }} rsync -avzP path/to/local/file.txt {{ site.remote.user }}@{{ site.remote.login }}:directory/path/on/{{ site.remote.name }}/
> ```
> {: .language-bash}
>
> The `a` (archive) option preserves file timestamps and permissions among

> preserves partially transferred files in case of an interruption and also
> displays the progress of the transfer.
>
> To recursively copy a directory, we can use the same options:

## Transferring files interactively with FileZilla

FileZilla is a cross-platform client for downloading and uploading files to and
from a remote computer. It is absolutely fool-proof and always works quite
well. It uses the `sftp` protocol. You can read more about using the `sftp`
protocol in the command line [here]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link
_extras/discuss.md %}).

Download and install the FileZilla client from
[https://filezilla-project.org](https://filezilla-project.org). After
installing and opening the program, you should end up with a window with a file
browser of your local system on the left hand side of the screen. When you
connect to the cluster, your cluster files will appear on the right hand side.

To connect to the cluster, we'll just need to enter our credentials at the top
of the screen:

* Host: `sftp://{{ site.remote.login }}`
* User: Your cluster username
* Password: Your cluster password
* Port: (leave blank to use the default port)

Hit "Quickconnect" to connect. You should see your remote files appear on the
right hand side of the screen. You can drag-and-drop files between the left
(local) and right (remote) sides of the screen to transfer files.

Finally, if you need to move large files (typically larger than a gigabyte)
from one remote computer to another remote computer, SSH in to the computer
hosting the files and use `scp` or `rsync` to transfer over to the other. This
will be more efficient than using FileZilla (or related applications) that
would copy from the source to your local machine, then to the destination
machine.

## Archiving files

One of the biggest challenges we often face when transferring data between
remote HPC systems is that of large numbers of files. There is an overhead to
transferring each individual file and when we are transferring large numbers of
files these overheads combine to slow down our transfers to a large degree.

The solution to this problem is to *archive* multiple files into smaller
numbers of larger files before we transfer the data to improve our transfer
efficiency. Sometimes we will combine archiving with *compression* to reduce
the amount of data we have to transfer and so speed up the transfer.

The most common archiving command you will use on a (Linux) HPC cluster is
`tar`. `tar` can be used to combine files into a single archive file and,
optionally, compress it.

Let's start with the file we downloaded from the lesson site,
`hpc-lesson-data.tar.gz`. The "gz" part stands for *gzip*, which is a
compression library. Reading this file name, it appears somebody took a folder
named "hpc-lesson-data," wrapped up all its contents in a single file with
`tar`, then compressed that archive with `gzip` to save space. Let's check
using `tar` with the `-t` flag, which prints the "**t**able of contents"
without unpacking the file, specified by `-f <filename>`, on the remote
computer. Note that you can concatenate the two flags, instead of writing
`-t -f` separately.

```
{{ site.local.prompt }} ssh {{ site.remote.user }}@{{ site.remote.login }}
{{ site.remote.prompt }} tar -tf hpc-lesson-data.tar.gz
hpc-intro-data/
hpc-intro-data/north-pacific-gyre/

hpc-intro-data/north-pacific-gyre/NENE01751A.txt
hpc-intro-data/north-pacific-gyre/NENE01729A.txt
hpc-intro-data/north-pacific-gyre/NENE02040Z.txt
```
{: .language-bash}

This shows a folder containing another folder, which contains a bunch of files.
If you've taken The Carpentries' Shell lesson recently, these might look
familiar. Let's see about that compression, using `du` for "**d**isk
**u**sage".

```
{{ site.remote.prompt }} du -sh hpc-lesson-data.tar.gz
36K     hpc-intro-data.tar.gz
```
{: .language-bash}

> ## Files occupy at least one "block"
>
> If the filesystem block size is larger than 36 KB, you'll see a larger
> number: files cannot be smaller than one block.
{: .callout}

Now let's unpack the archive. We'll run `tar` with a few common flags:

* `-x` to e**x**tract the archive
* `-v` for **v**erbose output
* `-z` for g**z**ip compression
* `-f` for the file to be unpacked

When it's done, check the directory size with `du` and compare.

If you want to reverse the process &mdash; compressing raw data instead of
extracting it &mdash; set a `c` flag instead of `x`, set the archive filename,
then provide a directory to compress:

```
{{ site.local.prompt }} tar -cvzf compressed_data.tar.gz hpc-intro-data
```
