## Cheatsheets for Queuing System Quick Reference

* [SLURM](https://slurm.schedmd.com/pdfs/summary.pdf)

## Units and Language

A computer's memory and disk are measured in units called *Bytes* (one Byte is 8 bits). As today's
files and memory have grown to be large given historic standards, volumes are noted using the
[SI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units) prefixes. So 1000 Bytes is a
Kilobyte (kB), 1000 Kilobytes is a Megabyte (MB), 1000 Megabytes is a Gigabyte (GB), etc.

History and common language have however mixed this notation with a different meaning. When people
say "Kilobyte", they mean 1024 Bytes instead. In that spirit, a Megabyte is 1024 Kilobytes.

To address this ambiguity, the [International System of Quantities](
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Quantities) standardizes the *binary* prefixes
(with base of 2<sup>10</sup>=1024) by the prefixes Kibi (ki), Mibi (Mi), Gibi (Gi), etc. For more
details, see [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_prefix).
