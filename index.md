This workshop is an introduction to using high-performance computing systems effectively. We
obviously can't cover every case or give an exhaustive course on parallel programming in just two
days' of teaching time. Instead, this workshop is intended to give students a good introduction and
overview of the tools available and how to use them effectively.

By the end of this workshop, students will know how to:

* Use the UNIX command line to operate a computer, connect to a cluster, and write simple shell
  scripts.
* Submit and manage jobs on a cluster using a scheduler, transfer files, and use software through
  environment modules.
